# -Analysis-of-Junior-Cricketers-Performance-for-IPL-Selection

 In this project, we analyzed IPL cricket data from the years 2007 to 2017, focusing on both
 matches and ball-by-ball i.e delivery data. Using Python and its data analysis libraries, we
 explored various aspects such as match locations, winning teams, top-performing batsmen
 and bowlers, number of wickets taken, and Man of the Match position earned by players.
 The analysis helped uncover trends in team performance across different venues, player
 consistency, and match outcomes. Visual tools like bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps were
 used to present the insights effectively. This project provided valuable insights into
 performance metrics and helped understand strategic factors for helping and
 understanding more about the outcomes of IPL matches.
